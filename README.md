The **PADS Layout Parser** is a modern TypeScript library designed to parse **PADS Layout ASCII files** (`.asc` format), which are widely used in the design and manufacturing of PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards). This library provides an efficient way to transform netlist data from PADS files into structured object representations. These objects can be used for circuit analysis, design automation, or data conversion tasks.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Parses PADS Layout ASCII netlist files (`.asc` format).
- ✅ Handles key sections such as `*PART*`, `*NET*`, and `*SIGNAL*`.
- ✅ Extracts important design information like part reference designators, footprints, net names, and pin connections.
- ✅ Robust error handling with line number reporting for invalid syntax or unexpected data.
- ✅ Fully typed TypeScript API for enhanced developer experience.
- ✅ Optimized for compatibility with existing design and simulation tools.

## 📦 Installation

To install the **PADS Layout Parser** library via npm, use the following command:

```bash
npm install pads-layout-parser
```

## 🌐 Plain JavaScript build (no Node.js / TypeScript required)

The [`js/`](js/) folder contains a standalone JavaScript version of the parser for
environments where Node.js and TypeScript are not available (e.g. locked-down work
computers):

- **`js/pads-tool.html`** — a self-contained browser app. Copy this single file
  anywhere, double-click it, and drop a `.asc` / `.pads` file onto the page (or paste
  the text). It shows parts, nets, a BOM cross-check, and errors/warnings, and can
  copy tab-separated data straight into Excel (Ref Des, Part Type, Decal/Footprint,
  Side, X, Y, Rotation) or download CSV/JSON. Everything runs locally in the browser;
  no network access, no install.
- **`js/pads-parser.js`** — the parser as a single dependency-free script. Load it
  with a `<script>` tag (creates the `window.PADS` global) or `require()` it from
  Node/CommonJS.

The JavaScript build additionally auto-detects and parses **PADS Layout design ASCII
exports** (`!PADS-POWERPCB-Vx.x-UNITS!` header, as produced by PADS Layout
*File → Export*), extracting part placement (part type, decal, X, Y, rotation, board
side) from the `*PART*` section and pin connections from `*SIGNAL*` blocks — in
addition to the `*PADS-PCB*` netlist format the TypeScript library handles.

Behavioral notes (deliberate differences from the TypeScript library): control
statements are matched case-insensitively, sections may appear in any order, inline
`//` comments are stripped, name-length limits produce warnings instead of errors,
and names are never truncated.

```js
// Browser (after loading a script tag with src="js/pads-parser.js"):
const parser = new PADS.PADSParser(true); // true = lenient mode
const netlist = parser.parseSync(padsFileText);
console.log(netlist.format, netlist.parts, netlist.nets, netlist.errors);
console.log(PADS.toLayoutPartsTSV(netlist)); // paste-ready for Excel
```

Development helpers (need Node.js, but only for maintaining the tool itself):

```bash
node js/run-tests.js   # runs the JS parser against the fixtures in __tests__/
node js/build-tool.js  # re-inlines pads-parser.js into pads-tool.html
```

## 📖 Usage Examples

You can use the library to parse PADS Layout ASCII files and extract the design information, including parts and net connections.

### Parsing from String
```typescript
import { PADSParser, PADSNetlist } from 'pads-layout-parser';

const padsData = `
*PADS-PCB*
*PART*
U1 MY_FOOTPRINT
R1 RES0805
*NET*
*SIGNAL* NET1
U1.1 R1.1
*SIGNAL* NET2
U1.2 R1.2
*END*
`;

const parser = new PADSParser();
const netlist: PADSNetlist = parser.parse(padsData);
console.log(JSON.stringify(netlist, null, 2));
```

### Parsing from File
```typescript
import * as fs from 'fs';
import { PADSParser } from 'pads-layout-parser';

const filename = 'my_netlist.asc';
const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf8');

const parser = new PADSParser();
const netlistFromFile = parser.parse(fileContent);
console.log(JSON.stringify(netlistFromFile, null, 2));
```

## 📚 File Format Description

### PADS Layout ASCII File Format

The PADS Layout ASCII file format consists of a structured text representation of PCB design data. It uses control statements enclosed in asterisks (`*`) to demarcate different sections. The key sections and their format are described below:

#### `*PADS-PCB*`
The file starts with the `*PADS-PCB*` marker, which indicates that the file is a PADS Layout PCB file. This section does not contain data but signals the start of the file.

#### `*PART*`
The `*PART*` section defines the components in the PCB design. Each part consists of a reference designator (e.g., `U1`) and a footprint (e.g., `MY_FOOTPRINT`). Optionally, a value (e.g., `RES0805`) may also be included.
```plaintext
*PART*
U1 MY_FOOTPRINT
R1 RES0805
```

#### `*NET*`
The `*NET*` section defines the nets in the design. This section starts the netlist definition and does not contain net information itself. It indicates that subsequent `*SIGNAL*` sections will define the connections between pins of parts.
```plaintext
*NET*
```

#### `*SIGNAL*`
The `*SIGNAL*` section defines the actual signal connections between parts in the PCB design. Each signal has a net name (e.g., `NET1`) and one or more pin connections (e.g., `U1.1 R1.1`), where each pin pair represents a connection between two parts.
```plaintext
*SIGNAL* NET1
U1.1 R1.1
*SIGNAL* NET2
U1.2 R1.2
```

#### `*END*`
The `*END*` control statement marks the end of the file or the end of a section.

### Data Structures

The following data structures are used to represent the parsed PADS data:

#### `PADSNetlist`
```typescript
interface PADSNetlist {
  parts: PADSPart[];
  nets: PADSNet[];
}
```

#### `PADSPart`
```typescript
interface PADSPart {
  refdes: string; // Reference designator (e.g., U1, R1)
  footprint: string; // Footprint name (e.g., MY_FOOTPRINT, RES0805)
  value?: string; // Optional value (e.g., RES0805)
}
```

#### `PADSNet`
```typescript
interface PADSNet {
  name: string; // Net name (e.g., NET1, NET2)
  pins: PADSPin[]; // Array of pin pairs
}
```

#### `PADSPin`
```typescript
interface PADSPin {
  refdes: string; // Reference designator (e.g., U1, R1)
  pin: string; // Pin number (e.g., 1, 2)
}
```

## ⚙️ Error Handling

The parser provides detailed error messages when it encounters invalid syntax or unexpected data in the input file. The error messages include line numbers and descriptions of the issue, making it easier to debug PADS Layout ASCII files.

## 🧪 Testing & Coverage

To run the test suite and ensure the parser works correctly, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
